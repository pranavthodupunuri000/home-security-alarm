# home-security-alarm
The Home Security Alarm System is a motion-detection–based security solution built using an ESP32 microcontroller, a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor, and a buzzer. The system continuously monitors the surrounding area for human movement using the PIR sensor, which detects infrared radiation emitted by living objects.
